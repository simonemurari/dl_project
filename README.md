# Deep Learning Project
To run this notebook you need python 3.10+ with the packages you can find in the requirements.txt file, an NVIDIA GPU compatible with CUDA 11.4 and TensorRT 10.1.0 installed. \
If you just want to see the results you can look at the _project.html_ file where you can see an already run notebook. \
