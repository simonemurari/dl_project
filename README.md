# Deep Learning Project
To run this notebook you need to clone the repo and create a python 3.10+ environment with the packages you can find in the requirements.txt file. You need an NVIDIA GPU compatible with CUDA 11.4 and TensorRT 10.1.0 installed. \
If you just want to see the results you can download the _project.html_ file where you can see an already run notebook. \
